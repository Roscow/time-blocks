        <p>This is a basic project for improving my productivity. It doesn't have any goal of being shown to anyone, just for my personal enjoyment. However, it's public, so if you see it, have fun... The following words are for my:</p>
        <strong>To Reach Perfection</strong><br>
        <p>Perfection doesn't exist, but we try to reach it anyway. I made this tool in one day just to reach my own personal, incomplete perfection.</p>   
        <strong>What are the rules for that??</strong><br>
        <ol>
            <li>* Have time for learning—anything. You always need to keep studying, no matter your age, profession, status, or gender.<br></li>
            <li>* Have time for physical work; train your body—it's your tool.<br></li>
            <li>* Organize your meals.<br></li>
            <li>* Stay informed; read the news, read articles.<br></li>
            <li>* Socialize—it's a great task to multitask. You can socialize while exercising, playing games, eating, or watching TV/movies/series. Don't miss the opportunity to socialize doing these things all by yourself.<br></li>
            <li>* Multitask the mundane—washing dishes, doing laundry, cooking, reading emails.<br></li>
            <li>* For important things ,you need focus. dont watch tv or multitask<br></li>
            <li>* While focusing, music (sober one) and earplugs are fine, but videos are not.<br></li>
            <li>* If one day you are asked to break this schedule to try something new, don't doubt it, do it.<br></li>
            <li>* Give your tasks the proper time; it's better to have time left than to be rushing all the time.<br></li>
            <li>* Always prefer to do things in a diferent location. Being so much time enclosure its a decease.</li>
